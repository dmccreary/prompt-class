# About This Website

I have always been facinated with language.  I got my first exposure
to language tools when I discovered [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)
in the late 1990s.  It was amazing to see a formal database representation
of words I used every day.  Leveraging WordNet for writing and search
opened a new door for me.  This helped me formalize my ability to visualize how to
represent concepts in a graph.

I first started using generative AI seriously when OpenAI release their first
tools in 2020.  I had been using BERT to analize clinical documents, and now
there was another model that would not only fill in a single word, but it
would continually guess a set of next words.

Back then it was just [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2),
but it still had potential.  I started blogging about 
[GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) in September of 2020
as a way to [Generate Detailed Lesson Plans](https://dmccreary.medium.com/using-al-to-generate-detailed-lesson-plans-29a5af200a6a) for my STEM students.

Although my peer group of graph and NLP researchers were interested in 
using these models for task automation, we found that by adding detailed
examples of what we wanted, we could dramatically increase the quality
of prompts.  So I started teaching informal one-hour sessions on
how to use GPT to perform various tasks that we had formally done by
building custom BERT models. 

The more we worked with GPT-3, the more we realized the incredible number
of tasks that this single model could do.  The demand for the class
continued and I launched both a half-day and eventually a full-day
of training for developers.  These were often the most popular classes
that were offered by our training group.

Since those early days, the power of generative AI has continued
to expand, but the role of writing good prompts is still critical
for you to get the most out of your models.

I hope that you find this course useful and I would appreciate
any feedback you have to help me make the course better.
