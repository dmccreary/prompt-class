The image is a vividly painted, dreamlike scene blending classical architecture, a serene landscape, and a touch of modern life:

Foreground:
A young woman with wavy auburn hair lies on her stomach at the stone edge of a reflective pool. She wears an off-the-shoulder white blouse and a flowing, burnt-orange skirt cinched with a sash. Her expression is bright and engaged, smiling as she types on an open laptop. The placement of the laptop — a contemporary object — creates a playful contrast with the otherwise timeless setting.

Setting:
The scene is framed by tall, fluted classical columns with ornate Corinthian capitals. These columns stand on either side of a long, still reflecting pool that stretches toward the horizon. The pool’s water mirrors the clouds, mountains, and sky with near-perfect clarity.

Background:
The far end of the pool aligns with a majestic sunset (or sunrise) framed by tall, pointed evergreen trees. Rolling mountains fade into the distance, bathed in golden light. The sky is filled with dramatic, soft-edged clouds in shades of orange, pink, and gold, contrasting with turquoise-blue sky patches.

Additional figures:
On both sides of the pool, seated women in long flowing garments are visible, each resting against the bases of columns. They add to the classical, almost Greco-Roman atmosphere.

Color palette & mood:
Warm oranges, golds, and pinks dominate the sky and clothing, harmonizing with cooler greens and blues from the trees and water reflections. The lighting is soft yet luminous, creating a tranquil and slightly surreal mood, as if the viewer is in a timeless, idyllic world where past and present mingle.

Welcome to the website for my prompt engineering course.  I have
been teaching this course since March of 2020.  I continually learn more about how to help students write better prompts to get better
results out of their large language models.  The course contains
the background about how large language models work and
many tips and tricks for you to get great results.

When people first start using generative AI they are sometimes
shocked at the high quality of the responses they get from using a
simple prompt.  Yet soon
they may become frustrated with their inability to control what they
get from large language models.  We hope we can guide you on your
way to overcoming these frustrations.
