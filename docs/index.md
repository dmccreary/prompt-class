# Prompt Engineering Course

![](./img/cover-small.png)

Welcome to the website for my prompt engineering course.  I have
been teaching this course since March of 2020.  I continually learn more about how to help students write better prompts to get better
results out of their large language models.  The course contains
the background about how large language models work and
many tips and tricks for you to get great results.

When people first start using generative AI they are sometimes
shocked at the high quality of the responses they get from using a
simple prompt.  Yet soon
they may become frustrated with their inability to control what they
get from large language models.  We hope we can guide you on your
way to overcoming these frustrations.
