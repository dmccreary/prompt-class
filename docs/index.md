# Prompt Engineering Course

Welcome to the website for my prompt engineering course.  I have
been teaching this course since March of 2020.  It contains
the essential terminology and background for you to
become familier with the role of prompt engineering.

When people first start using generative AI they are sometimes both
shocked at the quality of the responses and at they same time
they become frustrated with their inability to get what they
want from models.  This cource can help them get the most
out of large-langauge models as well as help with
image generation.

Please let me know if you find these tools useful.

Good Luck! [Dan McCreary on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmccreary/)
