# Instructor Notes

## Before the class

1. Make sure students all have access to a generative AI site such as OpenAI ChatGPT.
1. If ChatGPT is too slow you can also try out [Zephyr Chat](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-chat) on Hugging Face.
2. Remind the students they should all bring laptops to the classroom.
3. Suggest they bookmark the [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) site since we will be generating animations and simulations which they will copy to that editor.

## Classroom checklist

1. Tables with power and enough power strips for each student
2. Projector and connectors
