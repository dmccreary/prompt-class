# License Prompt

```
I want to share my traing materials for a class with other teachers.
I would like to allow them to use my lesson plans free.
I would like to ask for attribution.
I don't want them to resell my lessons for profit.

What creative commons license should I choose?
```

## Response

For your needs, the most suitable Creative Commons license would be the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) license. Here's why it aligns with your requirements:

1. **Attribution (BY):** This license requires others to give appropriate credit for your work, providing a link to the license, and indicating if changes were made. This aligns with your request for attribution.

2. **Non-Commercial (NC):** This aspect of the license prohibits others from using the material for commercial purposes. This means that while other teachers can use your lesson plans for free, they cannot sell them for profit, which is in line with your preference.

Under this license, teachers can share, copy, distribute, and transmit the work, as well as adapt it to fit their needs, as long as they attribute the work to you and don't use it for commercial purposes. Remember, though, that the definition of "commercial" can vary, so it's a good idea to be clear in your terms if you have specific concerns or definitions in mind.
