# Decomposition

Generative AI is VERY good at helping you break large projects down into smaller projects.
Here is an example of using Generative AI to decompose a large project into small tasks.

## Prompt

```linenums="0"
I want to create a web form that gathers information
to build an AI strategy for a company and then 
uses generative AI to sugget
some microstrategies to help them improve their innternal
capabilities with AI.

Suggest how I can break this problem down into smaller parts
so I can build this tool step-by-step.
```

## Sample Response

Building a web form and tool that leverages generative AI to suggest microstrategies for enhancing a company's internal AI capabilities is a multifaceted project. Here's a breakdown into smaller, manageable parts to help you develop this tool step by step:

### 1\. **Requirements Gathering and Planning**

-   **Define the Scope:** Clearly outline what the AI strategy tool will cover. This includes the types of companies it's aimed at (size, industry, current AI maturity level), and the range of AI capabilities it will suggest improving (e.g., data management, model development, deployment).
-   **Identify User Inputs:** Determine what information you need from the companies. This could include their current AI projects, tools, team skills, data infrastructure, and specific goals or challenges.
-   **Research AI Strategy Elements:** Understand the components of an AI strategy to ensure your tool provides comprehensive and relevant suggestions. This includes staying updated with AI trends and industry best practices.

### 2\. **Designing the Web Form**

-   **Select a Technology Stack:** Choose the technologies for frontend and backend development (e.g., React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend).
-   **Web Form Design:** Design the form to be user-friendly and intuitive, ensuring it collects all necessary information efficiently without overwhelming the user.
-   **Validation and Security:** Implement input validation to ensure data integrity and security measures to protect sensitive information.

### 3\. **Developing the AI Model**

-   **Select Generative AI Tools:** Decide on the generative AI models to use. This could involve using existing models like GPT (from OpenAI) for generating text-based strategies.
-   **Training/Customization:** If customization is needed, prepare a dataset for training or fine-tuning the AI models on strategy suggestions. This could involve gathering existing AI strategies and outcomes.
-   **Integration:** Develop the integration layer that connects your web form inputs with the AI model, ensuring the model can generate suggestions based on the input data.

### 4\. **Generating AI Strategy Suggestions**

-   **Implement Logic for Suggestions:** Build the logic that takes user inputs and translates them into prompts for the AI model. This involves creating a mapping between the company's current state (as described by the form inputs) and the types of suggestions that would be most useful.
-   **Customization and Refinement:** Allow for customization of suggestions based on the specific needs and context of the company, possibly including an iteration or feedback mechanism for users to refine suggestions.

### 5\. **User Interface and Experience**

-   **Displaying Suggestions:** Design how the AI-generated strategies will be presented to the user. This could include categorizing suggestions, prioritizing them, or providing additional resources for implementation.
-   **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a way for users to provide feedback on the usefulness of the suggestions, which can be used to improve the model and logic over time.

### 6\. **Testing and Iteration**

-   **Pilot Testing:** Before full deployment, test the tool with a small group of companies to gather feedback and identify any issues.
-   **Iterate Based on Feedback:** Use the feedback to refine the web form, the AI model's integration, and the presentation of the suggestions.

### 7\. **Launch and Continuous Improvement**

-   **Deployment:** Deploy the tool for wider use, ensuring it is hosted on a scalable and secure platform.
-   **Monitor and Update:** Continuously monitor the tool's performance, user feedback, and the evolution of AI strategies to update your suggestions and ensure relevance.

### 8\. **Documentation and Support**

-   **User Guide:** Create documentation to help users understand how to use the tool and interpret its suggestions.
-   **Technical Support:** Set up a support system for users to report issues or seek help with the tool.

Breaking down the project into these manageable steps allows you to focus on one aspect at a time, making the development process more structured and manageable. It also helps in ensuring that each component is thoroughly developed, tested, and optimized for the best possible user experience and effectiveness.
