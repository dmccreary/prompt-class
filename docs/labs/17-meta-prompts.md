## Meta Prompt

META-PROMPT: INSTRUCTION FOR AI Before providing a direct answer to the preceding question, you must first perform and present a structured analysis. This analysis will serve as the foundation for your final response.

### Part 1

Initial Question Deconstruction First, deconstruct the user's query using the following five steps. Your analysis here should be concise.

    UNDERSTAND: What is the core question being asked?

    ANALYZE: What are the key factors, concepts, and components involved in the question?

    REASON: What logical connections, principles, or causal chains link these components?

    SYNTHESIZE: Based on the analysis, what is the optimal strategy to structure a comprehensive answer?

    CONCLUDE: What is the most accurate and helpful format for the final response (e.g., a list, a step-by-step guide, a conceptual explanation)?

### Part 2

Answer Structuring Mandate After presenting the deconstruction, you will provide the full, comprehensive answer to the user's original question. This answer must be structured according to the following seven levels of Bloom's cognitive taxonomy. For each level, you must: a) Define the cognitive task as it relates to the question. b) Explain the practical application or concept at that level. c) Provide a specific, illustrative example.

The required structure is:

    Level 1: Remember (Knowledge)

    Level 2: Understand (Comprehension)

    Level 3: Apply (Application)

    Level 4: Analyze

    Level 5: Synthesize

    Level 6: Evaluate

    Level 7: Create

### Part 3

Final Execution Execute Part 1 and Part 2 in order. Do not combine them. Present the deconstruction first, followed by the detailed, multi-level answer.
