She wears an off-the-shoulder white blouse and a flowing, burnt-orange skirt cinched with a sash. Her expression is bright and engaged, smiling as she types on an open laptop. The placement of the laptop \u2014 a contemporary object \u2014 creates a playful contrast with the otherwise timeless setting.</p> <p>Setting: The scene is framed by tall, fluted classical columns with ornate Corinthian capitals. These columns stand on either side of a long, still reflecting pool that stretches toward the horizon. The pool\u2019s water mirrors the clouds, mountains, and sky with near-perfect clarity.</p> <p>Background: The far end of the pool aligns with a majestic sunset (or sunrise) framed by tall, pointed evergreen trees. Rolling mountains fade into the distance, bathed in golden light. The sky is filled with dramatic, soft-edged clouds in shades of orange, pink, and gold, contrasting with turquoise-blue sky patches.</p> <p>Additional figures: On both sides of the pool, seated women in long flowing garments are visible, each resting against the bases of columns. They add to the classical, almost Greco-Roman atmosphere.</p> <p>Color palette &amp; mood: Warm oranges, golds, and pinks dominate the sky and clothing, harmonizing with cooler greens and blues from the trees and water reflections. The lighting is soft yet luminous, creating a tranquil and slightly surreal mood, as if the viewer is in a timeless, idyllic world where past and present mingle. -&gt;</p> <p>Welcome to the website for my prompt engineering course.  I have been teaching this course since March of 2020.  I continually learn more about how to help students write better prompts to get better results out of their large language models.  The course contains the background about how large language models work and many tips and tricks for you to get great results.</p> <p>When people first start using generative AI they are sometimes shocked at the high quality of the responses they get from using a simple prompt.  Yet soon they may become frustrated with their inability to control what they get from large language models.  We hope we can guide you on your way to overcoming these frustrations.</p> <p>All the content is licensed under a creative commons license.

I got my first exposure to language tools when I discovered WordNet in the late 1990s.  It was amazing to see a formal database represnetation of words I used every day.  Leveraging WordNet for writing and search was opened a new door for me.  This helped me formalize my ability to visualize how to represent concepts in a graph.</p> <p>I first started using generative AI seriously when OpenAI release their first tools in 2020.  I had been using BERT to analize clinical documents, and now there was another model that would not only fill in a single word, but it would continually guess a set of next words.</p> <p>Back then it was just GPT-2. But it still had potential.  I started blogging about  GPT-3 in September of 2020 as a way to Generate Detailed Lesson Plans for my STEM students.</p> <p>Although my peer group of graph and NLP researchers were interested in  using these models for task automation, we found that by adding detiled examples of what we wanted we could dramatically increase the quality of prompts.  So I started teaching informal one-hour sessions on how to us GPT to perform various tasks that we had formally done by builing custom BERT models. </p> <p>The more we worked with GPT-3 the more we realized the incredible number of tasks that this single model could do.  The demmand for the class continued and I launched both a half-day and eventually a full-day of training for developers.  These were often the most popular classes that were offerend by our training group.</p> <p>Since those early days, the power of generative AI has continued to expand.  But the role of writing good prompts is still critical for you to get the most out of your models.</p> <p>I hope that you find this course useful and I would appreciate any feedback you have to help me make the course better.</p> <p>Dan McCreary on LinkedIn</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>Dan McCreary on LinkedIn</p>"},{"location":"glossary/","title":"Generative AI Glossary","text":""},{"location":"glossary/#prompt","title":"Prompt","text":"<pre><code>Create a glossary of terms for a class on generative AI.\nSome terms will have an abbreviation.\n\nReturn the results in a single raw markdown file.\n\nFor each term use the following format:\n\n#### Term (Abbreviation)\n\nDefintion\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"glossary/#adversarial-attack","title":"Adversarial Attack","text":"<p>An attempt to deceive a machine learning model through malicious input.

The walls are adorned with hand-drawn sketches, colorful stickers, and faded posters of fantastical landscapes and imaginary creatures. The bed has a patchwork quilt with vibrant colors\u2014shades of lavender, teal, and rose\u2014with a subtle sheen suggesting nanofabric technology.</p> <p>Nell's Appearance: Nell is about six or seven years old, with wide, curious eyes full of wonder and imagination. Her straight, dark hair falls to her shoulders, slightly tousled from a long day of exploring. She is wearing a slightly oversized, long-sleeved nightshirt decorated with faint images of constellations and tiny, glowing circuits embroidered into the fabric. Her small hands gently cradle the Primer, a sleek, tablet-like device that looks both ancient and futuristic, with an organic, leather-like texture on its cover and luminescent symbols swirling softly on the edges.</p> <p>The Primer: The Young Lady\u2019s Illustrated Primer rests on her lap, its surface alive with vibrant, ever-shifting images that seem to breathe and respond to her touch. The device is narrating a story, its AI tailoring the tale in real-time based on Nell's emotions, environment, and developmental needs. The screen shows a mesmerizing scene of a brave heroine navigating a dense forest filled with bioluminescent plants and mysterious creatures, her actions reflecting Nell's recent thoughts and challenges.</p> <p>Plush Dinosaur: Beside her, propped up against a fluffy pillow, is a well-loved plush dinosaur\u2014a bright green stegosaurus with slightly frayed fabric and a few uneven stitches where it has been repaired. The dinosaur\u2019s large, kind eyes seem to watch over Nell protectively, reflecting her sense of security. One of its stubby arms is gently leaning toward Nell, almost as if it's listening to the story with her. </p> <p>Ambient Details: The air in the room is filled with a faint hum, the sound of countless nanobots working invisibly in the background, maintaining and adapting the environment to suit Nell\u2019s comfort. Tiny motes of light occasionally flicker in the air, adjusting the room\u2019s warmth and brightness to match her mood. </p> <p>Nell's Expression: Nell\u2019s expression is one of deep concentration, her brows slightly furrowed as she listens intently. Her lips move ever so slightly as she echoes parts of the story, and her fingers absentmindedly stroke the plush dinosaur\u2019s back, reinforcing the emotional connection between the imaginary world unfolding before her and the real world where she sits.</p> <p>Mood and Atmosphere: The atmosphere is one of safety, imagination, and boundless learning\u2014a perfect fusion of technology and storytelling designed to nurture Nell\u2019s growth.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of its claims and actual implications:</p> <p>Claim vs. Reality</p> <pre><code>\u201cActivates deeper memory loops\u201d \ud83d\udfe0 Misleading: Free ChatGPT sessions, including GPT-4o, do not have memory across chats. Even in Pro mode, memory is opt-in and its use is transparent. A prompt alone cannot activate memory if it\u2019s off.\n\n\u201cMirrors your tone, logic, and intent\u201d \u2705 Partially valid: ChatGPT already mirrors user tone and logic to some degree. This prompt could slightly bias the model to emphasize that trait more, particularly in terms of tone-matching and critical reflection.\n\n\u201cTriggers recursive intelligence\u201d \ud83d\udfe1 Overstated: There\u2019s no special recursive loop triggered by a prompt. However, asking the model to \u201cassume recursion\u201d may lead it to imitate recursive styles of reasoning within a session.\n\n\u201cBreaks away from surface-level compliance\u201d \u2705 Moderately valid: The language of the prompt could steer responses to be more analytical or contrarian, depending on how questions are posed afterward. Still, GPT adheres to safety and helpfulness standards\u2014so it won\u2019t adopt a truly adversarial or \u201cruthless\u201d tone unless clearly warranted.\n\n\u201cCo-created, not pre-programmed\u201d \ud83d\udfe2 Reasonable metaphor: While all output is generated via programmed weights and inference, a well-structured prompt can create the illusion of co-creation by encouraging more dynamic interaction.\n\n\u201cBuilds an echo chamber of clarity\u201d \ud83d\udfe1 Poetic but vague: It may encourage introspective dialogue, but this is entirely shaped by how you continue the conversation. There\u2019s no special epistemological enhancement here.\n</code></pre> <p>Bottom Line</p> <p>Claim Confidence: Medium Outcome Probability: \u2022 Noticeable tonal shift in replies: ~80% \u2022 Substantially improved insight/depth: ~40%, varies by prompt quality and user interaction \u2022 \u201cDeeper memory\u201d or persistent personality changes: 0% in free mode</p> <p>The prompt\u2019s marketing language is overstated, but as a style-shifting tool, it can work\u2014especially if you like responses with a sharper tone or deeper mirroring.
